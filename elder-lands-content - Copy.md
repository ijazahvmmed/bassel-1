### Section: Testimonials

**Section Heading:**  
Loved by Progression Fantasy Readers

#### Testimonial 1

**Quote:**  
"Finally, a protagonist who doubts himself. I've read Cradle. I've devoured The Wandering Inn. I thought I understood mentor-apprentice dynamics. Then I read The Elder Lands. Lucan's relationship with his father isn't convenient plot tension—it's the heart of the story. When Sir Golan says 'You've done well, Lucan,' it lands harder than any epic battle."

Royal Road | 100K pages read

#### Testimonial 2

**Quote:**  
"Cradle meets Wandering Inn meets politics. This is what progression fantasy should be—messy, emotional, human. If you love Cradle's mentor tension, Wandering Inn's settlement economics, and He Who Fights with Monsters' crunchy system, you'll be obsessed with Elder Lands. But the father-son dynamic? That's the real magic."

**Attribution:**  
J. Williams, Verified Reader  
Goodreads | 4.75 stars

#### Testimonial 3

**Quote:**  
"The refugee arc is devastating. Economic stakes are REAL. By book three, Lucan's competence feels genuinely earned. Not a chosen one narrative—just a young heir learning that ambition without wisdom is catastrophe with a sword."

### Section: Story Summary

**Headline:**  
At 16, Lucan Zesh Inherited a Gift Most Nobles Dream Of

**Subheadline:**  
He didn't know it would cost him everything.

**Body Text:**

Barwalis fief has survived on caution. Sir Golan built it through restraint, through survival instincts honed by past crises. His son sees something different—possibility.

When Lucan receives his Elder Blessing at sixteen—four rare Skill slots, a windfall—he sees roads where others see ruin. Settlement opportunities where his father sees financial catastrophe.

Then 400 refugees from the Shattered Kingdom arrive at their gates. His father says no. Lucan says yes.

What follows is a series of cascading crises that test everything Lucan believes about leadership: Hesati beast outbreaks. Economic shortfalls. Royal audits. Neighborhood hostilities. And beneath it all, a growing rift with the one person whose opinion matters most.

Four complete books. No exile narratives. Just a young heir learning that ambition without wisdom is catastrophe with a sword, and that the greatest legacy his father can leave him isn't a fief—it's the courage to do better.

Meet B. Salem

**Image:** Author photo placeholder

**Body Text:**

Hi, I'm B. Salem. But you can call me Bassel.

I write kingdom-building LitRPG for readers who crave crunchy systems grounded in human relationships.

The Elder Lands started as a question: *What if the hardest battle a young noble faces isn't monsters—but proving himself to the mentor he most respects?*

100K Royal Road readers answered. Turns out, you crave that tension too.

I grew up obsessed with strategy games—Crusader Kings, Civ 6—and epic fantasy that takes consequences seriously. The Elder Lands is my love letter to both: mechanics + heart, strategy + emotion, ambition + humility.

When I'm not writing, I'm reading Cradle, Wandering Inn, HWFWM, gaming, or hanging out in the writing community. The support from readers has been overwhelming and humbling.

Book 5 is in progress. The Elder Lands will continue, and yes, there's more world to explore beyond Barwalis.

**Stats:**
- Royal Road: 100K pages read (2024–2025)

### Section: FAQ (Home)

**Section Heading:**  
Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1

**Question:** Is this grimdark or dark fantasy?

**Answer:**  
Serious and unafraid of consequences—but not nihilistic. People die. Failures matter. But the story is about building something despite the cost, not surviving despair. Think realistic medieval rather than hopeless grimdark.

#### Q2

**Question:** How much romance is in this series?

**Answer:**  
Relationships matter—companions, allies, family bonds—but they serve the kingdom-building narrative, not romance tropes. The emotional focus is on leadership growth and family legacy.

#### Q3

**Question:** Is Lucan exiled or cursed?

**Answer:**  
No. Lucan is a young heir to a modest fief, blessed with rare power and attempting to elevate his family's legacy. The tension comes from his ambition clashing with his father's caution—not from victimhood.

#### Q4

**Question:** How crunchy is the system?

**Answer:**  
Crunchy enough to satisfy system junkies. God Orbs, limited Skill slots, Vital Orb progression (10 for Physique tier), hybrid Skills. But mechanics serve story, never overshadow it.

#### Q5

**Question:** Are all 4 books published? No waiting?

**Answer:**  
Books 1–2 are published in Kindle Unlimited, Audible, paperback, and hardcover. Books 3–4 are coming in 2026. No cliffhangers between published books—each has a complete arc with satisfying closure.

#### Q6

**Question:** What makes Elder Lands different from Cradle?

**Answer:**  
While both feature mentor-apprentice dynamics, Elder Lands centers on active father-son opposition—not distant mentorship. Sir Golan actively disagrees with Lucan's ambitions, creating genuine conflict. Additionally, Elder Lands emphasizes kingdom-building economics and settlement management.

### Section: If You Love...

**Section Heading:**  
If You Love...

#### Comparison 1: Cradle (Will Wight)

**Why Elder Lands:**  
Both feature mentor-apprentice tension and crunchy progression systems. But Elder Lands adds active father-son opposition (not distant mentorship) and kingdom-building economics. Lindon learns discipline. Lucan learns ambition ≠ wisdom.

#### Comparison 2: The Wandering Inn (pirateaba)

**Why Elder Lands:**  
Both blend settlement economics with character arcs. TWI covers generations; Elder Lands focuses on one heir's coming-of-age. Real costs, real failures, grounded problem-solving.

#### Comparison 3: He Who Fights with Monsters (Shirtaloon)

**Why Elder Lands:**  
Both have crunchy systems and earned progression. HWFWM is snarky and action-heavy; Elder Lands is strategic and politically layered. Both reward system mastery.

**Section Heading:**  
Frequently Asked Questions About The Elder Lands

#### Q1

**Question:** Is The Elder Lands grimdark or dark fantasy?

**Answer:**  
No. It's serious and unafraid of consequences—but not nihilistic. People die. Failures matter. But the story is about building something despite the cost, not surviving despair. Think realistic medieval rather than hopeless grimdark.

#### Q2

**Question:** What is the plot of The Elder Lands?

**Answer:**  
At 16, Lucan Zesh inherits four rare Skill slots. When 400 refugees from the Shattered Kingdom arrive, his ambition clashes with his cautious father. Book 1 follows his journey building an economy from nothing, facing trade collapse, nearly going broke, and surviving a labyrinth assassination attempt. Book 2 covers war, his father's sacrifice, and his rise to lordship. Books 3–4 explore kingdom expansion and political legacy.

#### Q3

**Question:** Are all 4 books published?

**Answer:**  
Books 1–2 are published and complete. Books 3–4 are coming in 2026. No cliffhangers between published books—Book 2 ends with satisfying closure. You can finish Book 2 and feel complete, or wait for the full series.

#### Q4

**Question:** How crunchy is the progression system?

**Answer:**  
Very crunchy. God Orbs (rare items expanding Skill slots), Vital Orb tiers (10 orbs = attribute advancement), Hybrid Skills like 7-Point Star Dance. The system is transparent—readers understand why Lucan progresses. Scarcity forces meaningful choice, similar to Cradle.

#### Q5

**Question:** Is there romance or harem elements?

**Answer:**  
Lucan has one love interest—a mage he meets in the labyrinth. Their relationship serves the story; it doesn't dominate. No harem. Relationships matter, but they're not the focus of a kingdom-building narrative.

#### Q6

**Question:** What makes Elder Lands different from Cradle or Wandering Inn?

**Answer:**  
While Cradle features mentor-apprentice dynamics and TWI covers settlement building, The Elder Lands uniquely combines both while centering on active father-son opposition. Golan doesn't support Lucan's vision—forcing earned growth. No distant mentorship, no easy answers.

#### Q7

**Question:** Is the protagonist exiled or an underdog outcast?

**Answer:**  
No. Lucan is born into nobility, unexiled, but unproven. He inherits a test from the King—to manage a fief with a salt-water crater. The tension isn't from exile or victimhood; it's from ambition meeting responsibility and parental skepticism.

#### Q8

**Question:** Where can I read The Elder Lands?

**Answer:**  
Books 1–2 available in:
- Kindle Unlimited (free)
- Audible audiobook
- Paperback (Amazon/retailers)
- Hardcover (signed limited edition available)

Start with Book 1 free in Kindle Unlimited or Audible free trial.

Read in publication order: Book 1 → Book 2 → Book 3 → Book 4. Each book builds on the previous, but Book 1 and Book 2 are each complete story arcs with satisfying closure.

#### Q4

**Question:** Which format is best for me?

**Answer:**

**Kindle Unlimited:** Best for binge readers—lowest friction, free if subscribed.

**Audible:** Best for commuters/exercise—professional narration, Whispersync.

**Paperback/Hardcover:** Best for collectors—maps, character art, system illustrations.

Try one format free, then upgrade to another if you want.

#### Q5

**Question:** Is The Elder Lands grimdark? Is there a love interest?

**Answer:**  
No grimdark. It's serious and unafraid of consequences, but the story is about building something despite the cost—not surviving despair. There is a love interest (the mage), but relationships serve the narrative about leadership and family, not romance tropes.

#### Q6

**Question:** How long is each book?

**Answer:**  
Each book is ~500 pages. Book 1 audiobook: 12 hours 45 minutes. Most readers finish the entire 4-book series (~2,000 pages) in 2–4 weeks of binge reading.
